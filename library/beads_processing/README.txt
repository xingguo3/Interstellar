This is the Beads library for Processing. Follow these instructions to get started...

-- 1. Download and install Processing --

Go to http://processing.org/download/ and download and install Processing for your platform.

-- 2. Copy the Beads library into the Processing libraries directory --

Processing has a directory that contains 3rd party libraries. This is a directory called "libraries" inside the Processing sketchbook directory. Look in Processing's preferences to see where the sketchbook directory is, or change it. Move the "beads" directory from the "beads_processing" directory into the libraries folder. Restart Processing. From the "Sketch" menu you should be able to see the "beads" library in the list of libraries that are available for import.

-- 3. Work through the examples --

Now work through the tutorials in the tutorial folder. Each tutorial is a Processing sketch and should open automatically in Processing when double-clicked.
